A simple HTTP browser and server written in Ruby.

The server will run on port 8080 on local host by default. It can respond to valid GET requests with the requested file and invalid get requests with "404.html".

The browser can retrieve the HTML code from the server by GET method. I may add a simple functionality for POST method later.
